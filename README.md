Customer Churn prediction system
# Customer Churn Prediction System

This project was completed as part of **Task 2** of the Machine Learning Internship at **Future Interns**.

## 📌 Project Description
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on customer data. The system also provides churn probability and identifies key factors influencing customer churn to support business decision-making.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib

## 📊 Key Features
- Churn probability prediction per customer
- Feature importance analysis (key churn drivers)
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix and performance metrics
- Interactive Streamlit web application for real-time prediction
- Business insights and recommendations
